PSC was a second attempt at user space real-time and FSMLabs is no longer
actively supporting it. The current RTLinux
support for protected memory is the PSDD (Protected Space Development Domain)
and it is available only in RTLinux/Pro because we found that it requires
an enormous engineering effort. PSC works, however. Try it out. Improve it.
