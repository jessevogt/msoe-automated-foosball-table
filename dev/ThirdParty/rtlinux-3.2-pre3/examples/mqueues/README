Two kinds of stress tests:

	1) Several threads sending and receiving on the same message
	queue
	
	2) Several threads sending and receiving on differents message
	queues

The first kind has the limitation of sempahores performance, since
this is the mechanism used for synchronization. Mutual exclusion is
obtained using a semaphore by message queue, so two distincts threads
sending to distincts message queues are not in conflict.

Stress Tests with several writers and one reader on the same message
queue show RTLinux behaviour is not "normal" but is right. If there
are not free slots in the message queue, semaphores functionality can
give the free slot always to the same thread. If you want to see it,
use run_tests script with creator.o writer-1.o and reader-1.o
