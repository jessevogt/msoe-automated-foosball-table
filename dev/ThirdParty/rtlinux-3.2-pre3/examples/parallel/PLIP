 Pinout used is a de facto standard parallel null cable -- sold as
 a "LapLink" cable by various places.  You'll need a 12-conductor 
 cable to make one yourself.  

 The wiring is:

           SLCTIN      17 - 17
           GROUND      25 - 25
           D0->ERROR   2 - 15          15 - 2
           D1->SLCT    3 - 13          13 - 3
           D2->PAPOUT  4 - 12          12 - 4
           D3->ACK     5 - 10          10 - 5
           D4->BUSY    6 - 11          11 - 6

WARNING    Do not connect the other pins.  They are
           D5,D6,D7 are 7,8,9
           STROBE is 1, FEED is 14, INIT is 16
           extra grounds are 18,19,20,21,22,23,24

 If you want to play with these files , I would recoment you buy a normal 
 PLIP-cable and don't bother making one your self , if you mess up wiring
 you can actualy toast your parallel-port and if thats located on the 
 motherboard you are probably in trouble.

 for details on unsing PLIP connections check the file name PLIP in the
 howto/mini/ directory of any HOWTO site.
