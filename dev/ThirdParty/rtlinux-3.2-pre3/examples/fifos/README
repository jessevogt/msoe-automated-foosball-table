posix_fifo.c      : pure POSIX example - basically its passing O_CREATE to
                    open instead of calling rtf_create.
simple_fifo.c     : thats about as simple as fifo get on the rt-side
read_fifo.c       : and on the user side
fifo_ioctl.c      : setting up a fifo ioctl using the now available
                    macros in include/rtl_fifo.h - this will no work
                    with older versions than the current cvs (as of Feb 8 2004)
user_fifo_ioctl.c : usage of the registered ioctl from user-space
