The rt_process.c and monitor.c comprise an example program that tests
scheduling accuracy.  Execute "make test" or "run.sh" to run it. The Makefile
contains some insights.

The programs in *irq*.c test interrupt response times of both Linux and
RTLinux. You need two machines and a parallel cable to use it.

To do: this should be documented in more detail. There's some info
in Michael Barabanov's thesis which can be found at
