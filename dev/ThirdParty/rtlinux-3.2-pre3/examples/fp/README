This example demonstrates the use of floating point operations in
real-time processes.

Note: you must link in the math library (-lm) if you use functions
like sin() or cos() in your program (see the Makefile).

To run this example you must first compile and boot the RT-kernel,
then install the RT-scheduler module.
This program is compiled into the Linux module rt_process.o.

The program in fptest.c is meant to test the user mode FP operations
while the RT system is running.
