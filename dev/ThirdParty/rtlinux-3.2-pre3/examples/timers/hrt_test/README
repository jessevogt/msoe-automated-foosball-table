TEST: 2timers.c
 * This program demonstrates the use of POSIX.4 interval timers without 
 * queued signals. It simply creates a POSIX.4 interval timer that sends
 * a normal signal when it expires. The handler for this signal prints
 * a message, and increments a count. When the count reaches MAX_EXPIRATIONS,
 * the timer is deleted, and the program exits. 
	 * Set up the signal event that will occur when the timer 
	 * expires. 
	 * Create and set the timer.
	 * Delete the timer.
	 * Initialize the timer setting structure.
	 * Set up and install a signal handler for the signal that 
	 * the timer will send. 
	 * Busy wait until the timer expires MAX_EXPIRATIONS number 
	 * of times.

TEST: timers.c
	 * Test to see if timer goes off immediately if not a future time is
	 * provided with TIMER_ABSTIME 
	 * test to check timer cancellation by deletion
         * Test to see if timer goes off immediately if not a future time is
         * provided with TIMER_ABSTIME
