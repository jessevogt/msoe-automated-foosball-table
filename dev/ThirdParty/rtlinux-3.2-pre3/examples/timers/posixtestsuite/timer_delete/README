TEST: 1-1.c
 * Test that timer_delete() deletes a timer.
 * Steps:
 * - Create a timer to send SIGTOTEST on expiration and set up a signal
 *   handler to catch it.
 * - Activate the timer.
 * - Delete the timer before the timer had a chance to expire.  [Potential
 *   false failure here if the timer cannot be deleted in time.  However,
 *   the timer expiration will be set large enough that this should not
 *   be likely.]
 * - Sleep until the timer would have expired.
 * - If no signal was caught, PASS.  Otherwise, FAIL.
 *
 * For this test, signal SIGTOTEST will be used, clock CLOCK_REALTIME
 * will be used.

******************************************************************

TEST: 1-2.c
 * Test that after a timer is deleted by calling timer_delete(), it
 * cannot be armed by calling timer_settime().
 * Steps:
 * - Create a timer 
 * - Delete that timer
 * - Try to call timer_settime() on that timer and ensure it fails
 *   with errno==EINVAL.
 *
 * For this test, signal SIGTOTEST will be used, clock CLOCK_REALTIME
 * will be used.

******************************************************************

TEST: 5-1.c
 * Test that timer_delete() returns -1 and sets errno==EINVAL if
 * timerid is not a valid timer ID.

******************************************************************

TEST: 5-2.c
 * Test that timer_delete() returns -1 and sets errno==EINVAL when
 * trying to delete a timer that has already been deleted.
 * Steps:
 * - Run test case 1-1.c and then try to delete the timer again.
 *
 * For this test, signal SIGTOTEST will be used, clock CLOCK_REALTIME
 * will be used.
