POSIX Test Suite
----------------

The POSIX Test Suite is an open source test suite with the goal of
performing conformance, functional, and stress testing of the IEEE
1003.1-2001 System Interfaces specification in a manner that is
agnostic to any given implementation.

While active development and testing is currently happening on Linux,
our choice of portable tools should make this test suite usable on any
POSIX operating system.
