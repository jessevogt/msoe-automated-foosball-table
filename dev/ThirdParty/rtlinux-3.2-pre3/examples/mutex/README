This example demonstrate the use of mutexes in RTLinux programs.
The Linux init_module() function creates three threads that try to compete
for the mutex.  After successfully locking the mutex, each thread waits
for 500ms, and then unlocks the mutex.
The times spent in pthread_mutex_lock are reported
to show that the RT-threads actually block.

To run the example, type make test. You have to be at a Linux console (no X)
to see the results.
