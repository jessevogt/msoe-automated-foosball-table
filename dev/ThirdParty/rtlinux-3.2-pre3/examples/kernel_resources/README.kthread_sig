this is an example of "signaling" from rt-context to non-rt context to
wake up a kernel thread. As all the wake_up_* calls in Linux sooner or
later directly call the scheduler and the signal_* functions also are
not rt-safe a tasklet is used to jump from rt to non-rt context. Scheduling
tasklets is safe as its done with atomic bit operations only (see
include/linux/interrupts.h)
