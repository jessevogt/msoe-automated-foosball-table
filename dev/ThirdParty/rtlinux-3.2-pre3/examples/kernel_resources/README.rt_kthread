rt_kthread is an example of sharing address space between a kernel thread
a character driver and a rt-thread. 

Operation:

On insmod a character device is registered that allows reading of a message
containing the current value of a global variable with the ./read_rt_kthread
at the same time this value is printed in the kthread and in the rt_thread.
The kthread will loop in its inner loop for 60 times and then terminate, 
to terminate the kethread while it is still active, send it any signal (to 
find the pid of the kthread do  ps auxw  and it should show the rt_kthread 
close to the end of the output). If the kethread received a signal while it
was active it resets the global int myint_for_something to 0 and then exits.
