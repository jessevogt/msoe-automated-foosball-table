simple_device.c is actually not related to rtlinux at all - but as there are 
questions about how to write a simple driver on the mailing list from time 
to time a very simple driver is included here. It only provides 
open/read/release and these do nothing but issue a printk (view with dmesg)

to trigger the open/read/release load simple_driver.o and then run 
./read_simple_driver folowed by  dmesg  to see the printk's .

If you want to get a serious intro to writing linux device drivers and not 
only how to missuse them as an interface to rt-threads check "Linux Device
Drivers 2nd Edition" by Allessandro Rubini (publisher: O'Reilly)
