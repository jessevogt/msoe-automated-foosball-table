A very simple kthread example - a very dangorouse kthread example.

The kernel thread is only invoced to call execve and thats it - as it inherits
the environment of the user that launched the insmod ktherd1.o (you) the echo
goes to the this users console. basically this is nothing else than the 
kthread equivalent of the fairly useless userspace uthread1 (well its not a
thread but...).

---uthread1.c---
#include <unistd.h>
	
char cmd_path[256] = "/bin/echo";
char main_arg[] ="Hello User World";

main(){
	static char * envp[] = { "HOME=/root", 
		"TERM=linux", 
		"PATH=/bin", 
		NULL };
	char *argv[] = { 
		cmd_path,
		main_arg,
		NULL };
	int ret;

	printf("calling execve for %s \n",cmd_path); 
	ret = execve(cmd_path, argv, envp);

	/* if we ever get here - execve failed */
	printf("failed to exec %s, ret = %d\n", cmd_path,ret);
	return -1;
}
