More testing. All combinations of CPU flags, RT, non-RT, SMP, non-SMP, 2.2, 2.3
kernels.

Problem of fork(). If a process mmaps mbuff and then forks bad things happen.

Problem of deallocating mbuffs still having files pointing to them (selected)
-delayed until 0.7 -still not done.

See what kiobuf in 2.3 is.

Implement sizing up (or down - much harder) already allocated mbuff.
Will be done if someone asks and gives me 1-2 weeks.

Make /proc/mbuff optional (possibly separate module).
Write a nice mbuff listing and configuration tool (PERL?).

Any other wishes?
