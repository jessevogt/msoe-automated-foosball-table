This is a serial port driver for RT-Linux.

Send any comments to the RT-Linux mailing list at <rtl@rtlinux.cs.nmt.edu> and
to <jochen@uni-duesseldorf.de>. Patches are wellcome, please include a
descriiption with them.


Installation notes:

To compile, either use

  make -f Makefile.cvs

or put it into your automake/autoconf'ed project and add it as a subdir.
After compilation insmod the module and you are ready to go.

(Since I use automake/autoconf the Makefile.standalone might not be
up-to date.)
