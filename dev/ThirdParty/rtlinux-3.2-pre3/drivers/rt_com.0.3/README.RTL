This module allows RT-threads to communicate via serial ports.
The documentation is in the *.html files.

testcom.c and com_posix.c demonstrate basic communication.
They send and receive data through COM1 at 38400 bps, 8N1.
Run make tests to build them.

Before loading the rt_com module, you need to disable the
Linux serial driver for COM1 by running
setserial /dev/ttyS0 uart none.
Then connect another computer's COM port with a nullmodem cable and
run minicom or another terminal program on the other computer.


Note for com_posix.c: even if the table in rt_com.c is changed to use a
different COM port (e.g., irq=3, io=0x2f8 for /dev/ttyS1 or COM2), the
RT-thread should still open("/dev/ttyS0").

This is because this version of rt_com assumes the device minor
numbers correspond to the lines in the rt_com_table. This
"feature" remains to be fixed (see the TODO file).
