.B #include <linux/module.h> 
.B #include <linux/kernel.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rtf_ipc_create
creates a real-time fifo (RT-FIFO) of size
.I size
and assigns it the identifier
.IR fifo .
.I fifo
is a value unique within the system, and must be less than IPC_RTF_NO.
If 
.I rtl_to_linux
is 1, the fifo is used for transferring data from RT-Linux tasks to a Linux
process.  If
.I rtl_to_linux
is 0, the fifo is used for transferring data from a Linux process to
one or more RT-Linux tasks.
.PP
The rt_ipc RT-FIFO is a mechanism, implemented as a character device, to
communicate between real-time tasks and ordinary Linux processes.  It is
based on the Real-Time Linux RT-FIFO mechanism.  The
rtf_* functions are used by the real-time tasks; Linux processes use
standard character device access functions such as
.BR read(2) ,
.BR write(2) ,
and
.BR select(2) .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, 0 is returned.  On failure, a negative value is returned
as described below.
.SH ERRORS
.IP \fB-ENODEV\fP
.I fifo
is not less than IPC_RTF_NO and RTF_NO.
.IP \fB-EBUSY\fP
.I fifo
is already in use.  Choose a different ID.
.IP \fB-ENOMEM\fP
.I size
bytes could not be allocated for the RT-FIFO.
