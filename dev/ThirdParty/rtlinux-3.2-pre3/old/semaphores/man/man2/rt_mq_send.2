.SH NAME
rt_mq_send \- message queue 'send' operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #define MODULE
.B #include <linux/module.h> 
.B #include <linux/kernel.h> 
.B #include <linux/version.h> 
.B #include <linux/errno.h>

.BI "int rt_mq_send(rt_mq_t *" mq ", char *" msg ", RT_MQ_PRIO " prio ", RTIME " wait ");
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rt_mq_send
enqueues the data
.I msg
on the message queue
.IR mq .
The data is assumed to be of the size with which
.B rt_mq_init
was called.  If
.I prio
is RT_MQ_NORMAL, the data is queued at the end. If
.I prio
is RT_MQ_URGENT, the data is forced to the front of the queue.
An optional timeout can be specified.  If 
.I wait
is RT_WAIT_FOREVER, the function does not time out.  If
.I wait
is RT_NO_WAIT and the semaphore is not available,
.B rt_mq_send
returns immediately.  If
.I wait
is any other value, it represent a time at which the call to
.B rt_mq_send
should time out.  If that time is reached,
.B rt_mq_send
returns with -ETIME.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, 0 is returned.  On failure, a negative value is returned
as described below.
.SH ERRORS
.IP \fB-ETIME\fP
The timeout period expired.
.IP \fB-EAGAIN\fP
.I wait
was RT_NO_WAIT, and no space was available on the queue.
.IP \fB-EINVAL\fP
.I mq
does not point to a valid rt_mq_t.
