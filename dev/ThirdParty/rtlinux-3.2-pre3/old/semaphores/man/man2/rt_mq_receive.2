.B #define MODULE
.B #include <linux/module.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rt_mq_receive
dequeues the data
.I msg
from the message queue
.IR mq .
The data will be of the size with which
.B rt_mq_init
was called.
An optional timeout can be specified.  If 
.I wait
is RT_WAIT_FOREVER, the function does not time out.  If
.I wait
is RT_NO_WAIT and the semaphore is not available,
.B rt_mq_receive
returns immediately.  If
.I wait
is any other value, it represent a time at which the call to
.B rt_mq_receive
should time out.  If that time is reached,
.B rt_mq_receive
returns with -ETIME.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, 0 is returned.  On failure, a negative value is returned
as described below.
.SH ERRORS
.IP \fB-ETIME\fP
The timeout period expired.
.IP \fB-EAGAIN\fP
.I wait
was RT_NO_WAIT, and no data was available for dequeueing.
.IP \fB-EINVAL\fP

does not point to a valid rt_mq_t.
