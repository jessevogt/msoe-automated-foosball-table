This example demonstrates the use of semaphores and message queues.
Its output is to the console, so running it in a normal xterm
wouldn't be very interesting.  To use:

# 1.  make rtl		installs the rtlinux modules
# 2.  make rt_ipc		installs rt_ipc
2.  make		compiles the example
3.  make ins		installs (and runs) the example.  Output is to console.
4.  make rm		removes the example
