This directory have some Linux applications that help to test examples in the 
$(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/examples directory.

The names of the applications explain what they are by themselves (i.e. tcpClient
is a tcp client that helps to test the tcpserver module).

Before using them, you may change the IP addresses they are using, so change code 
first.

To compile any of the examples just type:
>make name_of_the_example

Example named prueba.c is intended to test both the udpserver.o module and the
tcpserver.o module. Its code is simple, take a look at it.

Once compiled, its use is:
>./prueba <number_of_connections>

This will connect number_of_connections times both with the tcpserver or the udpserver
running in RT-Linux.
