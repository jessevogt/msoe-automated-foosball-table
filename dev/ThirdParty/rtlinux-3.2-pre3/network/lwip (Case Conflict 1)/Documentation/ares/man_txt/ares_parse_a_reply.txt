ARES_PARSE_A_REPLY(3)                                    ARES_PARSE_A_REPLY(3)



NAME
       ares_parse_a_reply - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type A into a hos-
       tent

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_a_reply(const unsigned char *abuf, int alen,
            struct hostent **host);

DESCRIPTION
       The ares_parse_a_reply function parses the response to a query of  type
       A  into  a  struct hostent.  The parameters abuf and alen give the con-
       tents of the response.  The result is stored in allocated memory and  a
       pointer  to  it stored into the variable pointed to by host.  It is the
       caller's responsibility to free  the  resulting  host  structure  using
       ares_free_hostent(3) when it is no longer needed.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_a_reply can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
