ARES_DESTROY(3)                                                ARES_DESTROY(3)



NAME
       ares_destroy - Destroy a resolver channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_destroy(ares_channel channel)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_destroy function destroys the name service channel identified
       by channel, freeing all memory and closing  all  sockets  used  by  the
       channel.   ares_destroy invokes the callbacks for each pending query on
       the channel, passing a status of ARES_EDESTRUCTION.  These  calls  give
       the  callbacks  a  chance  to  clean up any state which might have been
       stored in their arguments.

SEE ALSO
       ares_init(3)
