ARES_FREE_HOSTENT(3)                                      ARES_FREE_HOSTENT(3)



NAME
       ares_free_hostent - Free host structure allocated by ares functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       void ares_free_hostent(struct hostent *host)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_free_hostent function frees a struct hostent allocated by one
       of the functions ares_parse_a_reply or ares_parse_ptr_reply.

SEE ALSO
       ares_parse_a_reply(3), ares_parse_ptr_reply(3)

NOTES
       It is not necessary (and is not correct) to  free  the  host  structure
       passed  to  the callback functions for ares_gethostbyname or ares_geth-
       ostbyaddr.  The ares library will automatically free such  host  struc-
       tures when the callback returns.
