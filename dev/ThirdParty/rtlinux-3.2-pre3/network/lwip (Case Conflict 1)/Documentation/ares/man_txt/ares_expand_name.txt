ARES_EXPAND_NAME(3)                                        ARES_EXPAND_NAME(3)



NAME
       ares_expand_name - Expand a DNS-encoded domain name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_expand_name(const unsigned char *encoded,
            const unsigned char *abuf, int alen, char **s,
            int *enclen)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_expand_name  function converts a DNS-encoded domain name to a
       dot-separated C string.  The argument encoded gives  the  beginning  of
       the  encoded domain name, and the arguments abuf and alen give the con-
       taining message buffer (necessary for  the  processing  of  indirection
       pointers  within  the  encoded domain name).  The result is placed in a
       NUL-terminated allocated buffer, a pointer to which is  stored  in  the
       variable  pointed to by s.  The length of the encoded name is stored in
       the variable pointed to by enclen so that the caller can  advance  past
       the encoded domain name to read further data in the message.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_expand_name can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   Expansion of the encoded name succeeded.

       ARES_EBADNAME  The  encoded  domain name was malformed and could not be
                      expanded.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
