ARES_PARSE_PTR_REPLY(3)                                ARES_PARSE_PTR_REPLY(3)



NAME
       ares_parse_ptr_reply  - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type PTR into a
       hostent

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_ptr_reply(const unsigned char *abuf, int alen,
            const void *addr, int addrlen, int family,
       struct hostent **host);

DESCRIPTION
       The ares_parse_ptr_reply function parses the response  to  a  query  of
       type  PTR into a struct hostent.  The parameters abuf and alen give the
       contents of the response.  The parameters  addr,  addrlen,  and  family
       specify  which address was queried for; they are not used to verify the
       response, merely used to fill in the address  of  the  struct  hostent.
       The  resulting  struct  hostent  is  stored  in  allocated memory and a
       pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by host.  It  is  the
       caller's  responsibility  to  free  the  resulting host structure using
       ares_free_hostent(3) when it is no longer needed.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_ptr_reply can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
