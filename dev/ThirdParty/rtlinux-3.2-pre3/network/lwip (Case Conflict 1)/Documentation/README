Once inserted, the stack offers a sockets-like API to the RT-Tasks
that can be used to send and receive packets over a network. The
sockets API is build over the "sequential API" (which is quite similar
to the BSD socket API) and achieves effectiveness using RTL-lwIP as it
utilizes knowledge of the internal structure of the stack. RTL-lwIP
also offers another API called raw API which is not only faster in
terms of code execution time but is also less memory intensive. Two
reports written by Adam Dunkels (lwIP's author) include a reference
manual of the lwIP API, a manual for the raw API and a description of
the sockets API (note that all communication APIs are inherited from
lwIP, so more documentation can be found in its home page)


- The manual describing the raw API is raw_api.txt which is included
in this directory.  
- The lwIP API and the sockets API can be found in
this location:

- The Operating System Emulation Layer API is described in OSEL.pdf,
also included in this directory.
