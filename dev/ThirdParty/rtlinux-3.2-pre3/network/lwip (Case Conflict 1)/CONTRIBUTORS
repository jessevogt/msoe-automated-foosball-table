The RTL-lwIP project, besides the SISTEMAS DE TIEMPO REAL EMPOTRADOS, FIABLES Y
DISTRIBUIDOS BASADOS EN COMPONENTES own work, consists basicly in two portings:

- Porting lwIP to RT-Linux - which author is Adam Dunkels - and
- porting the Linux driver for the 3Com905C-X Ethernet Network Card - written by 
  Donald Becker - to RT-Linux.

The SISTEMAS DE TIEMPO REAL EMPOTRADOS, FIABLES Y DISTRIBUIDOS BASADOS EN COMPONENTES
people would like to thank those who have helped in any manner to develope this 
project:

- Kieran Mansley who helped with licensing and lwIP questions and discussions.
- Marc Boucher who ported the Asyncronous DNS client to lwIP enhancing the 
  capabilities of RTL-lwIP.
- Der Herr Hofrat, helped with RT-Linux questions and also with licensing questions.
- Ismael Ripoll, helped with ideas, answering questions, preparing the RTL-lwIP 
  distribution, and more ...
- Josep Vidal, helped with timers and signals questions.
- Miguel Masmano, whose implementation of a dinamyc memory manager is hardly used here.
