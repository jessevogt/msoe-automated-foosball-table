RTL-lwIP doesn't need to be installed, just needs to be compiled.
(see README section REQUIREMENTS in order to install all the necessary)

Before compiling it take a look at the rtl_lwipopts.h file. Some parameters must be 
changed (such as the IP address assigned) and others may.

In order to compile RTL-lwIP users must set the macros RTLINUXPATH and LINUXPATH
in the Makefile.

Before inserting the modules, RT-Linux must be started. Do it by yourself or run
>./start
./start also inserts rtl_debug.o, which may help in some cases.

If you've installed all that RTL-lwIP needs to run (see README section REQUIREMENTS), 
just type 
>make

It generates three modules that must be inserted in one specific order.

1.- Insert rtl_lwip_tools.o . rtl_lwip_tools has a dinamyc memory manager wich can work with 
bigphysarea (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED). If you are not using bigphysarea (ok, do it youself)
just run
>insmod rtl_lwip_tools.o
If you're using bigphysarea, configure the memory that de memory manager is going to
use in the script instools and then run it:
>./instools

2.- Insert the rt_3c905x_phys.o module. You can do that by hand or running the script 
>./inscard

3.- And finally insert the RTL-lwIP TCP/IP stack:
>insmod rtl_lwip_stack.o


RTL-lwIP by itself doesn't do anything. You can ping the RTL-lwIP TCP/IP stack from other
machine if you want, but that is all what you can do just with RTL-lwIP TCP/IP stack.

Try to compile some of the examples in the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/examples and test it.
Also, in the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix you will find Linux applications that will help
you to test some of the examples. Read README in those directorys.
