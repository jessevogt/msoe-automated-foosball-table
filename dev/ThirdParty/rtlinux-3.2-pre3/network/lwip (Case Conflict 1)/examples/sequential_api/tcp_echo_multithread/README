INTRODUCTION
This is an example of a tcpserver running in RTLinux.
In this case, tcpserver creates a thread for each incoming connection, so many tcpclients
can be inserted at once.

CONFIGURATION
Modify sources to assign correctly IP addresses.

EXECUTION
From the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES) directory run
>make tcpthreaded 


First you must have inserted the RTL-lwIP TCP/IP stack.
Once done, do:
>insmod tcpthreaded.o


In the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix are available some Linux apps to test tcpserver module.

If you run in RT-Linux the tcpthreaded.o module, in the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix run multiple
>tcpClient <tcpserver_ip> <text>
