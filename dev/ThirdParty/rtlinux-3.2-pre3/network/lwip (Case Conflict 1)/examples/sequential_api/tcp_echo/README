INTRODUCTION
This is an example of a tcpserver and client running both in RTLinux.

CONFIGURATION
Modify sources to assign correctly IP addresses.

EXECUTION
From the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES) directory run
>make tcpserver || make tcpclient


First you must have inserted the RTL-lwIP TCP/IP stack.
Once done, do:
>insmod tcpserver.o || insmod tcpclient.o


In the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix are available some Linux apps to test tcpserver and 
tcpclient modules.

If you run in RT-Linux the tcpserver.o module, in the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix run
>tcpClient <tcpserver_ip> <text>

If you want to run in RT-Linux the tcpclient.o module, in the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix 
previously you have to had run
>tcpServer
