Nicholas McGuire <der.herr@hofr.at> is currently managing 
releases of RTLinux/GPL. The staff of FSMLabs contributes 
and also maintains the commercial version RTLinux Pro.

Researchers at the University of Valencia in Spain and other
members of the European Community OCERA project are now
actively contributing to RTLinux/GPL. The Current development
incorporated from the OCERA projects include:

 * POSIX signals
 * POSIX timers
 * POSIX message queues
 * POSIX bariers
 * lwIP stack
 * ..more still to be merged..

special thanks to Jose Ismael Ripoll <ismael.ripoll@disca.upv.es> for 
development, coordinative work and code review.

For more information see www.ocera.org. 

RTLinux was first developed by Michael Barabanov
and myself. Many students at New Mexico Tech
contributed to the early development. I 
want to thank Oleg Subbotin, Ramesh Nalluri, Axel Bernal,
Hua Mao, Bill Crum, but there must be others who I have
forgotten. Please send me a note and pleae be respectful about
age and memory. The project no longer exists at New Mexico Tech
but is alive both commercially and in universities around the 
world. What follows is an old list, please send us updated
information. If you are maintaining some RTLinux code or 
offering support, please write and we can put your name in 
the final 3.2 release.

The mbuff driver was contributed and maintained by Tomasz Motylewski

The idea of driving rtl_printf from a soft interupt
