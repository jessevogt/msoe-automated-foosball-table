you are developing commercial software or making commercial or

a support contract. Please consider carefully whether you get a
benefit from our work and would like to see it continue. If you are
developing GPL V2.0 code only, you don't need a special license &ndash;
although you may want the Pro version for other reasons. If your
applications include non-GPL code, you may or may not need an
additional license, but we suggest some care. The GPL requires that
all work derived from GPL software be released under GPL. The Open
RTLinux Patent License provides a royalty free use of the patent only
for GPL software. Contrary to what you might read on the Internet,
&ldquo;using an API&rdquo; or &ldquo;putting code in modules&rdquo;
or other tricks to make a barrier between GPL and non-GPL code don't
work. If you have questions, ask us by sending email to

GPL is quite definitive on the following condition: If you begin with
a GPL Program and produce a new program from the original GPL Program
so that the new program is &ldquo;derived&rdquo; from the original,
the new program must also be released under the GPL. The simple case
for this is when your new program is produced by a change in the code
of the original program. In this case, you must license the new
program including the changes under the GPL. Things are more complex
when the new program is produced by attaching a plug-in, a module, or
a discrete component of some sort to the original program. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>RTLinux/Free and any GPL
implementation of the RTLinux dual kernel process are also restricted
under the terms of the Open RTLinux Patent License. This license
permits royalty free use of the RTLinux dual kernel process by GPL
software, and it offers only one, limited exception to this
requirement. In general, all components of software (modules,
programs, plugins, code, etc.) that are used with the RTLinux dual
kernel process under this license must be released under the GPL.
That is, if an application, as a whole, makes use of the RTLinux dual
kernel process under the GPL provisions of the Open RTLinux Patent
License, the software as a whole must be licensed under the GPL under
the strictest interpretation of the provisions of the GPL. You cannot
meet the requirements of the license by splitting software into
separate programs,modules, or other software components and only
releasing some of them under the GPL. The GPL is a copyright license
and so the boundaries that might exist between programs may be 
boundaries of the effect of the GPL. The Open Patent License applies
to &quot; software&quot; that makes use of the patented process even
if this software consists of many distinct programs, modules, or
other software components.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>As an example, if you
distribute a data acquisition system that consists of an
implementation of the RTLinux dual kernel process, a driver, and a
control program, the entire collection of programs must be licensed
under the GPL in order to make use of the royalty free Open RTLinux
Patent License. If your program only makes incidental use of the
RTLinux Patented Process it is not subject to the license &ndash; but
we suggest that you either ask us or get qualified legal advice. Both
the GPL and the RTLinux Open Patent License are aimed at facilitating
use of GPL code with GPL code, and you should be careful about other
uses.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>Yes, of course, We take
nearly anything reasonable into the &quot;contributions&quot; list.
Code that we like and test gets integrated into the main body of the
code. Like nearly all other open-source projects, we require a
release before we integrate contributions into the main code. Most
other projects, such as GCC and ReiserFS, require assignment of
copyright. We don't ask for copyright, because we do not want to
restrict your rights to later reuse your code. Instead, we require a
release so that we retain our rights over RTLinux. See the file 
contrib.txt for details.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>The GPL is a license that is
offered by the copyright owners of some programs. The copyright
owners still own the code however, and have unchallenged right to
license the code under any other terms of their choice. Since FSMLabs
owns the copyright for RTLinux outright, FSMLabs has the right to
offer a version of its RTLinux software under a commercial license as
well. Since RTLinux is not derived from Linux, but is an independent
program that uses Linux as an optional application, RTLinux is not
subject to the terms of the Linux GPL. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>It is sometimes argued that
programs that run in the same hardware memory space with a GPL
program must be released under GPL. This is not strictly correct. The
test is whether the result is a &ldquo;derived work&rdquo;, A little
thought shows that this distinction is necessary: BIOS programs run
in the hardware address space shared with Linux, MS DOS , which has
no hardware memory protection, runs GPL programs, uCLinux only runs
on processors with no hardware memory protection at all and so on.
The important issue is not whether the hardware enforces address
space separation, but whether the programs are independent and
running in their own logical address spaces or whether they are
components of the same program using a logical single address space. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>When RTLinux starts running,
it allocates memory for its own use or attaches to pre-allocated
memory and this memory space is intended to be used by RTLinux and
not shared with Linux. In fact, the entire real-time capability of
RTLinux depends deeply on the very limited and highly structured
nature of interactions between RTLinux and the general purpose
operating system base. RTLinux generally does not use hardware to
enforce this separation of address space, but this is an
implementation choice to improve efficiency and has nothing to do
with whether there is the kind of sharing of address space that is
seen when a program is linked to a library. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=2>FSMLabs wants to encourage
experimentation with the RTLinux process and derived programs under
the provisions of the RTLinux Open Patent License and the GPL. We try
to avoid imposing unnecessary restrictions, especially on educational
and other non-commercial use. However, programs derived from RTLinux
source, or making use of the RTLinux Open Patent license are required
to follow the terms of the Open Patent License (where applicable) and
the GPL. People modifying, distributing or using this code have no
legal right to grant further rights or to re-license under other
licenses. Many commercial projects need to escape from the GPL
restrictions and we are happy to offer additional licenses to those
projects. If you are using RTAI for a product which makes use of the
RTLinux Patented Dual Kernel Process and your product contains
non-GPL code, you should contact FSMLabs to determine whether you
need a commercial license.</FONT></FONT></P>
